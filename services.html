                <p>About 60-75 children receive lunch at the Home of Blessing on Thursdays, Fridays, and Saturdays.<br><br></p>
                <p>God has sustained this feeding program and filled the stomachs of many children through MIRACLES. We would like to share just a couple examples with you:<br><br></p>
                <p>After about 1 and a half years of Dennys and Yolanda cooking for the kids, they began to pray for God to send more workers. They couldn’t hire anyone and didn’t want to go out looking for help. They were confident that God would send them. This is about the time that Nolvia began to serve through cooking, then Gissella, then her sister Marisol. These women continue to cook 3 meals a week and their husbands often serve as well. These 3 women receive no pay, no credit, but plenty of hugs and thanks from the children.<br><br></p>
                <p>One day, one of the cooks asked Yolanda, “What are we going to have tomorrow?” Yolanda responded, “I’ll let you know in the morning.” She had no idea what would be served because there was no food left in the pantry and no money to purchase more. What would they eat? How would they eat? Dennys and Yolanda prayed, “God we have the heart to serve you, but we don’t have the ability to purchase food. Send what you have to provide for these children.” Two hours later, Dennys received a phone call and an invitation to meet up for coffee in town. They met up with a few members of a mission team that wanted to serve at the Home of Blessing. As their time together seemed to be wrapping up, the team asked Dennys and Yolanda if they had some extra time to go to the super market. This group proceeded to bless the Home of Blessing with $600 to get food from the supermarket. The kids were blessed with the treat of fried chicken the very next day!<br><br></p>

                <p>Three Bible studies are held on Saturday mornings before lunch. After worship and prayer time together, the 75 children divide up into different classes. Their ages determine which class they are in: 3-6, 7-9, and 10-15 year olds each get to hear the word of God, be loved on by a teacher, and be reminded how much God really cares for them.</p>
