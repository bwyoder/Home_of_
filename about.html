            <p>Here is a bit of Denny’s and Yolanda’s story:<br><br></p>
            <p>Dennys and Yolanda married on April of 2006. The first 4 years of their marriage were the hardest. At that time, they were not following God’s call for their lives. Instead, they were constantly concerned about how they would make a living and tried out  one business opportunity after another with no gain. Many different people who knew them from different areas of life encouraged them to do ministry and stop pursuing business. Over and over, they heard, “God has a ministry for you.” After a very hard day in 2010, Dennys and Yolanda held each others hands and prayed. In this prayer they felt God speak to them Phillipians 4:19, “And my God will meet all your needs according to the riches of his glory in Christ.” During this prayer, they committed to never ask for anything and instead put everything in God’s control. They asked the Lord to help their concerns to be spiritual and that whether they continued in business or began a ministry that God would utilize them.  After this moment, God allowed Dennys and Yolanda to serve in unique ways and showed them His calling. They would travel to places with plans to serve prostitutes or elderly or in evangelism or maintenance, but God always made His plans known. Despite the plans that were made, He always had them working with children and God awoke them to more needs in their community. In their own words, “God opened our eyes and hearts to at-risk children. We started to hear stories of children in our community, stories of kids who were abused- physically, spiritually, verbally; we were being asked for food to eat and money for medicine, but more than anything we saw that the community needed to be shown love”<br><br></p>
            <p>There was a day that Dennys and Yolanda invited 4 of the children to have dinner with them. At that time, they thought that it was a good idea to take time to also talk to the children about Jesus, show them a Bible verse and demonstrate the love, forgiveness, and salvation that Jesus offers. That is how the home of blessing began- A few kids, in the Valasquez home, sitting on the floor, eating spaghetti.<br><br></p>
            <p>Now there are 83 children that come to the Home of Blessing for meals and Bible studies. Eight of those families are now involved in local churches. All the children who are of age are now going to school because uniforms, notebooks, backpacks, and medical care have been provided to them.<br><br></p>
            <p>Despite the fact that we don’t like to ask for -help, God always provides, needs are always met, and expectations are always exceeded.<br><br></p>
            <p>We want to thank God for his faithfulness:<br>EVERY BLESSING has come from God</p>
